/** Gated Recurrent Unit RNN Layer.<br>
 * The GRU was recently proposed by Cho et al. 2014 - http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1078<br>
 * It is similar to the LSTM architecture in that both use a gating structure within each unit
 * to attempt to capture long-term dependencies and deal with the vanishing gradient problem.
 * A GRU layer contains fewer parameters than an equivalent size LSTM layer, and some research
 * (such as http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.3555) suggests it may outperform LSTM layers (given an
 * equal number of parameters) in some cases.
