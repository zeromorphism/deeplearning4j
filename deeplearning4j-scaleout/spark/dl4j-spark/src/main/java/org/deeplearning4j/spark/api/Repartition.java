 * "Never" and "Always" repartition options are as expected; the "NumPartitionsWorkersDiffers" will repartition data if and only
 * if the number of partitions is not equal to the number of workers (total cores). Note however that even if the number of partitions
 * and number of workers differ, this does <i>not</i> guarantee that those partitions are balanced (in terms of number of
 * elements) in any way.
